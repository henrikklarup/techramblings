# What are engineering principles
Collaboration is a key element in any organization.
Collaboration allows the different parts to accelerate eachother, and it makes for a better outcome at the end.
Software engineerings spend a lot of their time collaborating within their teams, but how do we ensure the collaboration is smooth, the objectives the same, and the standard aligned with eachother?

There might be multiple ways of doing this, but one I've found works well is with **team engineering principles**.

First let me explain what I feel engineering principles, and then get into the team specific parts.

Engineering principles is a way to align an engineering department by setting some common values and guiding lights for engineers to follow when making decisions.
Some good examples of engineering principles can be found here:
- [Zalando engineering principles](https://github.com/zalando/engineering-principles)
- [Google engineering principles](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/principles/)

These are good to do on a company level, and one important thing is to formulate the principles in such a way that:
1. They don't communicate a rule (You must you X-technology vs Aim for low coupled architecture)
2. They strive for exellence (Quality comes first)
3. They are easy to remember (e.g. YAGNI - you ain't gonna need it)

It's hard to write good principles, so it might go through a couple iterations, remember to make it an ongoing process.
