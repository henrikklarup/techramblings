# Whats a tech choice?
As engineers we often make choices or take decisions about things like 'Which framework to use?', 'What datastore is best for this use case?' and 'What architectural pattern should I apply here?'.
These are all examples of tech choices, and for me tech choices is everything which supports our tech journey.

# Why are tech choices important?
As I mentioned before engineers take a lot of decisions about following one or the other path on the journey. There might be multiple paths which will lead to the same place, some might have pitfalls, and others might accelerate you in the wrong direction.

It's important to make decisions, as the act of not making a choice also has a cost attached to it. If we stop making choices or taking decisions we risk slowing down, or getting stuck, while others overtakes us. Always keep moving forward. In my view it's better to make a decision to do something, and then redo it later, rather than postponing the decision and risk never taking it, and being left in the in the dust.

# Who should make the choice?
As I've transitioned into a new role, I find myself making decisions about different choices than I would before. A lot of the decisions I dealt with as a developer was mostly about very technical choices, such as 'which pattern to apply' or 'which framework or tools fits this problem'.
These choices seem harder for me to have a qulified opinion about, as I've moved further away from hands-on-work, and now I find my mind being occupied with a different set of choices and decisions.

Therefore it's important that choices are made on the right level.
One of the pitfalls I've seen is that 'managers' tries to control which framework, programming language or design pattern a team should use for a given project, when the manager is only there 10% of the time. This can lead to what I would call 'forced choices' or micromanagement. The manager in this case might believe that if he/she is not there to make the decision, then the team will go haywire and choose something completely insane. Most teams will try to make good choices, and they are, in most cases, more than capable of taking the companies best interest into account.

As a manager I find that it's important to trust and allow the teams to make the choices they feel good about, and ithen trust me enough to pull in my opinion when they feel it's needed.


# Tech trends
Tech moves fast, and especially when one stops doing the hands on work, it's easy to get out of touch with what is trending, and become stuck in the choices of the past.

The choices of the past feels safe, we have already seen them working as they have gotten us to where we are today, but if we don't renew ourselves and keep up with the world around us, we get slower and slower while everybody else overtake us.
So how does one keep up with the trends? What are the cool kids looking to next, and how do you evaluate which trends survives and which ones never gain the tracking to become a real player in the field.

# Transparency into your own choices
As previously mentioned it can lead you on the path towards success or sometimes towards the abyss, therefore it's equally important to reflect on the
