# Whats a tech choice?
As engineers we often make choices or take decisions about things like 'Which framework to use?', 'What datastore is best for this use case?' and 'What architectural pattern should I apply here?'.
These are all examples of tech choices, and for me tech choices is everything which supports our tech journey.

# Why are tech choices important?
As I mentioned before engineers take a lot of decisions about following one or the other path on the journey. There might be multiple paths which will lead to the same place, some might have pitfalls, and others might accelerate you in the wrong direction.

It's important to make decisions, as the act of not making a choice also has a cost attached to it. If we stop making choices or taking decisions we risk slowing down, or getting stuck, while others overtakes us. Always keep moving forward. In my view it's better to make a decision to do something, and then redo it later, rather than postponing the decision and risk never taking it, and being left in the in the dust.

# Who should make the choice?
As I've transitioned into a new role, I find myself making decisions about different choices than I would before. A lot of the decisions I dealt with as a developer was mostly about very technical choices, such as 'which pattern to apply' or 'which framework or tools fits this problem'.
These choices seem harder for me to have a qulified opinion about, as I've moved further away from hands-on-work, and now I find my mind being occupied with a different set of choices and decisions.

Therefore it's important that choices are made on the right level.
One of the pitfalls I've seen is that 'managers' tries to control which framework, programming language or design pattern a team should use for a given project, when the manager is only there 10% of the time. This can lead to what I would call 'forced choices' or micromanagement. The manager in this case might believe that if he/she is not there to make the decision, then the team will go haywire and choose something completely insane. Most teams will try to make good choices, and they are, in most cases, more than capable of taking the companies best interest into account.

As a manager I find that it's important to trust and allow the teams to make the choices they feel good about, and then trust me enough to pull in my opinion when they feel it's needed.

# Tech trends
Tech moves fast, and especially when one stops doing the hands on work, it's easy to get out of touch with what is trending, and become stuck in the choices of the past.

The choices of the past feels safe. We have already seen them working and they have gotten us to where we are today, but if we don't renew ourselves, we eventually get slower and slower while everybody else overtake us.

So how does one keep up with the trends? What are the cool kids looking at now? And how do you evaluate which trends has a potential to survive, and which ones never gain the tracking to become a real player in the field.

For my case the answer to most of these questions are the same - tech radars.

## Tech radar
Tech radar or technology radar was first used as a term by the company Thoughworks. It's a company which helps other companies dealing with tech, and because of their unique position they get to see a lot of what goes on in big and small technology companies.
Based on this they created the [Thoughworks technology radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). 

The radar is a pretty simple concept.

It is a radar which is updated every half year, by an advisory board from within Thoughworks. Its split into four quandrants Techniques, Tools, Platforms, and Languages & Frameworks.
Each quadrant has four rings, Adopt, Trial, Asses and Hold.
Within each of the quandrants and rings, 'blips' are placed.
A blip is a representation of a specific technique, tool, platform, etc.
The closer the blip is to the middle, the more of a stable choice it is. If it's in the hold category you should be causios using it.
If a blip is in two consequtive editions of the tech radar, then movement is also indicated, so one can see if it moves closer or further away from middle, or if it is a new addition.

The reason I really like this tech radar is due to the fact that each blip is well described. This makes it really easy to get a good overview, but also to reject the ones which would not fit into ones own organization.

There are other companies doing technology radars too, which are also worth a look:
- [Zalando](https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/)
- [The software house](https://tsh.io/technology-radar)
- [Tarmac](https://www.tarmac.io/techradar)

# Transparency into your organizations tech choices
Technology radars are not just for other companies. They can also be used in your own organization to asses the choices already made, or to asses possibilities or opotunities which could accelerate you.

Thoughtworks allow you to [build your own](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/byor), but just supplying the data. This can be a great opotunity internally in your company to help you coordinate experiments across teams, and gain the knowledge when one team finds a new and promising technique. 

# Final thoughts
I have really wanted to do a technology for a long time, and my organisation is warming up to the idea. Not only can it help internal communication about which technologies we use, but it can also help give candidates a good look into where the company wants to move, if it's made public.
We are starting to do team specific tech radars first, and will then move into company wide tech radars, and then hopefully in the not so distant future make it public.

Thansk for reading along.
