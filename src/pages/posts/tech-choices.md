# Whats a tech choice?
As engineers we often make choices or take decisions about things like 'Which framework to use?', 'What datastore is best for this use case?' and 'What architectural pattern should I apply here?'.
These are all examples of tech choices, and for me tech choices is everything which supports our tech journey.

# Why are tech choices important?
As I mentioned before engineers takes a lot of decisions about following one or the other path on the journey. There might be multiple paths which will lead to the same place, some might have pitfalls, and others might accelerate you in the wrong direction.

It's important to make decisions, as the act of not taking a choice also has a cost attached to it. If we stop making choices or taking decisions we risk slowing down or getting stuck, while others overtakes us. Always keep moving forward. In my view it's better to make a decision to do something, and then undo it later, rather than post-poning the decision and risk never noticing that we should have taken it ealier.

# Who should take the choice?
As I've transitioned into a new role, I find myself making decisions about differnet choices than I would before. A lot of the decisions I dealt with as a developer was mostly about very technical choices, such as 'which pattern to apply' or 'which framework or tools fits this problem.
I've found that choices in some cases can become harder to take some of these choices the further one moves away from hands-on-work, 


# Tech trends
Tech moves fast, and especially when one stops doing the hands on work, it's easy to get out of touch with what is trending, and become stuck in the choices of the past.
The choices of the past feels safe, we have already seen them working, they have grotten us to where we are today, but if we don't renew ourselves and keep up with the world around us, we slowly grow slower while everybody else overtake us.
So how does one keep up with the trends? What at the cool kids looking to next, and how do you evaluate which trends survives and which ones never gain the tracking to become a real player in the field.

# Transparency into your own choices
As previously mentioned it can lead you on the path towards success or sometimes towards the abyss, therefore it's equally important to reflect on the
