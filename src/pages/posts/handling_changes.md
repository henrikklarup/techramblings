# Change is constant
There are many quotes about change, starting from the most famous one by Heraclitus "The only constant in life is change"

Change will be there in personal life, as well as professional settings. Some changes are good, some are bad, but as Benjamin Franklin put it: "When you are finished changing, you are finished".

Therefore there is no reason to spend energy trying to avoid changes. You can try keeping the status quo for a while, but at some point, someone or something will make a change with affects you.
Your time and energy is much better spend trying to predict the impact of the changes, and adjust accordingly.
